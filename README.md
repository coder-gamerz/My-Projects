# About Me
. am a bit shortsighted and try to make anything i can get my hands on. I mean I literally sat for an entire day straight just trying to make a shell calculator that calculates area and perimeter of shapes. And that to between classes! I have 3 Â½ years of experience in coding. And Btw, if you didn't realize by now, I am still under 15 years old!

. also like to play video games, mostly fps(first person shooter) like Valorant, CS 2.0, Overwatch, Splitgate, Apex Legends etc. I am alos a huge fan of anime! I also dont like ads and slow processing, that's why i learned all about computers by learning how to make them, making their os kernels, and even learning how to make sure that they are of great value by finding out all the ranges and budget of GPU and CPUs (This was all done with a little help from websites, and a lot of help from Linus Tech Tips!). 

. use Opera GX as my browser. Though i keep switching, i come back every time to Opera GX. That is because of the ads and tracker blocking, free VPN (although a http proxy but fine) and integration of all social media also with discord and twitch support in the sidebar. It also added ChatGTP to the sidebar!
